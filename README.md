DD Hospital is a hospital management information system program based on EZ UNIVERSITY TUTORIAL EXAMPLES. This hospital management information system program is mainly used to record the information of doctors and patients and management of hospitalization information.

The administrator name of this application is tester, and the password is {iSchoolUI}. In addition, there is a super user whose name is ddm and the password is ddmddm. The two accounts of tester and ddm can access all information and can add and delete Information freely. These two accounts are the hospital administrators in my image, they need to monitor the daily staff changes. There is also a username who can browse the content of the application called clerk, and the password is {iSchoolUI}. This user can browse the hospital's departments, doctors, patients, and other information, but he is not allowed to add information in it, because of the envisaged working scenario of the clerk, he should be the administrative staff of the hospital, responsible for communicating with the outside world and answering questions. He does not need to be responsible for daily information records; there is also an account called registra, and the password is {iSchoolUI}. In my design, registra should be the registrars belonging to the hospital. They record the patients admitted to the hospital every day, but they are not responsible for the specific diagnosis results.
